            <p>The Information Technologies degree at Mizzou has two main focues. First being software engineering and computer management. 
                The other being digital media design, development, and production. We will dive deeper into these two focuses in 
                <a href="https://github.com/jakesimpkins/jakesimpkins.github.io/blob/main/page2.html" target="_blank">page2.html</a> and 
                <a href="https://github.com/jakesimpkins/jakesimpkins.github.io/blob/main/page3.html" target="_blank">page3.html</a>. 
                For now we will just be focusing on the degree as a whole. A great source for information about the degree can be found at the

            <p><b>Why I chose Mizzou IT</b></p>
            <p>I originally came to Mizzou to study computer science. I was always impressed by coding and the ability to understand how a machine worked.
             As excited as I was to be studying in the field, I was told of the IT program on my first day of classes. It was explained to me for the
             first time how computer science and IT are similar but have important <i>differences</i> that need to be understood. Where computer science
             studies how code was created and the math behind coding, IT focuses on <span class="green">implementing</span> the code for design. Here are some of the ways we
             study the use of code in IT.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Web Development</li>
                <li>Software Engineering</li>
                <li>Media Design</li>
                <li>Data Analysis</li>
                <li>and More!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After just a few weeks of class I have already began to develop projects with coding languages such as <i>python, HTML,</i> and <i>JavaScript</i>.
             I have also began learning how to use software like photoshop to create mock websites and logos. Examples of both are included below.</p>
            <p><b>JavaScript from a FizzBuzz challenge</b></p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    function fizzbuzz() {
                        var display = document.getElementById('display');
                        var displayHTML = "";
                        for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
                        if (i % 3 != 0 && i % 5 != 0) {
                          displayHTML += i;
                        } else if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 != 0) {
                          displayHTML += "Fizz";
                        } else if (i % 3 != 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
                          displayHTML += "Buzz";
                        } else if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
                          displayHTML += "FizzBuzz";
                        }
                </code>
