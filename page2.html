            <p>One of the main focuses in the <span class="yellow">Mizzou IT</span> degree is software development and computer management. This focuses typically emphasizes the
                 <a href="https://grasshopper.app/why-coding/" target="_blank">coding</a> aspect of computers, my favorite. Through this focus we learn 
                 about how code can be used to manipulate data, create a website, design an app, and much more. There are hundreds of coding languages 
                 out there but some of the languages we focus on include
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>Swift</li>
                <li>And More!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although this is my favorite aspect of the degree so far, it's not everybody's. The degree also focuses on digital media design which is discussed more in

            <p>Below I included some examples of what a small <b>Python</b> coding project looks like along with what a class assignment looks like.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    import math

                    print ('This program is designed to output the volume of a cylinder based off '
                          'of user inputs! To do this, a height and radius is required.')
                    Height = float(input('Please provide a height for the cylinder: '))
                    Radius = float(input('Please provide a radius for the base of the cylinder: '))
                  
                    Rsqr = Radius * Radius
                    Volume = math.pi * Height * Rsqr
                  
                    print('The volume of your cylinder is ' , Volume)
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>This project simply asks for an imput from the user and calculates the volume of a cylinder with the provided parameters.
                 Below I included the original assignment so you can see what we as a student recieve and learn from.
