            <p>To conclude the <b>Information Technology</b> degree offered at Mizzou is a lot more than what it sounds like at a surface level.
                 When I heard IT in the past my mind went to a person sitting in an office at a school offering help to teachers with projector 
                 problems but its so much more. The degree gives students the tools required to create anything they can think of when it comes 
                 to software. Here are just some of the possible things a student could create through the <i>Mizzou IT program</i>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Websites</li>
                <li>Graphics</li>
                <li>IOS Applications</li>
                <li>Android Applications</li>
                <li>Software Development</li>
                <li>Projects like This</li>
                <li>And More!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On top of the multiple possible outlets to utilize the skills learned in school, almost every career in the above categories comes with a starting salary of at
                 least <b>$60,000</b>. Not only will you enjoy what you do, you'll get payed well to do it! The best place to find information related to the degree is

                 also give good information about the degree as whole and the focuses within it. Below is an image that shows the core required classes for any student
                  looking to major in IT at <span class="yellow">Mizzou</span> as well as an example code of one of my favorite projects we have done so far.
